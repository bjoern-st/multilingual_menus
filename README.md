Multilingual Menus
==================

Multilingual menus helps to deal with user menus on mulitilingual sites.

This module enhances user menu on multilingual sites in three ways:
 - it adds an additional column with the menu item language to the menu
   overview form. With that option menu items can be sorted by language.

 - it adds an language select field to the menu item edit form so you can give
   select a language for an menu item in the same way as you can for nodes.

 - it adds a preprocess function for blocks to filter out only those menu items
   that belong to the selected site language in menu blocks.
